# Triage Issue

Establish the facts a human needs to decide whether OpenShell should address an issue and, if so, where it belongs on the roadmap. Triage does not authorize work, sequence it, or produce an implementation plan.

## Prerequisites

- The `gh` CLI must be authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- You must be in a git repository with a GitHub remote
- The workflow labels `state:validated`, `state:accepted`, and `state:needs-info` must exist. Report missing labels to the operator; do not create them implicitly.

## Critical: Disposition and Roadmap Placement Are Human-Only

Triage establishes technical validity; it does not decide whether valid work belongs on the roadmap. Agents must never:

- Decide that OpenShell should or should not invest in otherwise valid work.
- Apply or remove `state:accepted`.
- Add an issue to the roadmap project, apply or remove the `roadmap` label, or recommend a specific roadmap item.
- Apply `agent:plan-requested` or `agent:implementation-requested`.
- Treat technical validity as product acceptance.

OpenShell has no `priority:*` labels. Sequencing comes from association with an item on the OpenShell Roadmap, and that association is a maintainer decision.

`state:validated` means the factual assessment is complete and awaits human disposition. A human declines by closing the issue as not planned with a rationale, or accepts by applying `state:accepted`, placing the issue on the roadmap, or doing both as documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Accepted work may remain human-owned. A maintainer can queue deeper agent investigation or planning with `agent:plan-requested`, or directly ask an agent to work on a specific issue.

The optional `agent:*` workflow controls unattended queue pickup: `agent:plan-requested` queues planning, and `agent:implementation-requested` queues implementation after plan review. A direct user instruction separately authorizes the phase it requests and does not require either label.

## Agent Comment Marker

All comments posted by this skill **must** begin with the following marker line:

```
> **📋 triage-agent**
```

This marker distinguishes triage comments from human comments and from other skills (`🏗️ build-from-issue-agent`, `🔒 security-review-agent`, etc.).

## Invocation Modes

This skill supports two modes:

### Single Issue

```
triage issue 250
triage issue #250
```

Assess one specific issue. Proceed to Step 1 with the given issue number.

### Batch

```
triage issues
```

Batch mode requires a confirmation gate before processing. This prevents accidental mass-commenting on a public repository.

**Step 1: Preview.** Query all matching issues and display a summary:

```bash
gh issue list --label "state:triage-needed" --state open --json number,title --jq '.[] | "#\(.number) \(.title)"'
```

Present the results to the user:

```
Found N issues with state:triage-needed:

  #250  Bug: sandbox fails to start with VM driver
  #312  Feature: add --output yaml to sandbox list
  ... (show up to 10, then "and N more")

This will post a triage comment on each issue.
```

**Step 2: Confirm.** Ask the user for explicit confirmation before proceeding. Use `AskUserQuestion` with options "Proceed with all N issues", "Let me pick specific issues", and let them provide custom input. Do **not** proceed without confirmation.

**Step 3: Process.** Only after confirmation, run the full triage workflow (Steps 1-7 below) for each issue. Report a summary at the end listing each issue and its classification.

## Step 1: Fetch the Issue

Strip any leading `#` from the issue number and fetch the issue.

```bash
gh issue view <id> --json title,body,state,labels,author,comments
```

If the issue is closed, report that and stop.

## Step 2: Check for Prior Triage

Search the issue comments for the triage agent marker (`> **📋 triage-agent**`).

- **If the marker is found** and no subsequent human comments exist with new information or questions, report that the issue has already been triaged and stop.
- **If the marker is found** but there are newer human comments with additional information, proceed to Step 3 to re-evaluate with the new context.
- **If a human already declined the issue, applied `state:accepted`, or placed it on the roadmap**, do not undo or reinterpret that decision.
- **If the marker is not found**, proceed to Step 3.

## Step 3: Check Report Completeness

Check for a substantive User Story, Problem Statement, Impact / Why This Matters, and Acceptance Criteria. The impact should explain the consequences of the current behavior and any insufficient workaround. For bug reports, also identify the reproduction steps and relevant environment. For feature requests, review the Proposed Design and Alternatives Considered. Reporter-supplied diagnostics and agent output are optional and must not be used as an intake gate.

If the report contains enough context to understand and assess the need, continue. If a required section lacks material information, classify it as `needs-information`, request only the exact missing information, remove `state:triage-needed`, and add `state:needs-info`.

- If a public issue may disclose a security vulnerability, do not repeat or expand sensitive details. Classify it as `security-report` and direct the operator to `SECURITY.md`.
- Route usage questions and support requests to the documented support venue.
- Handle clear duplicates, wrong-repository reports, and objectively expected behavior without requiring a full technical investigation.

Proceed to Step 4 for reports requiring technical validation.

## Step 4: Check Reported Version and Known Fixes

Before deeper diagnosis, determine whether the report may already be fixed in a newer release.

1. Extract the reported OpenShell version from the issue body, environment section, logs, and comments. If no version is provided, record that as missing context and continue.
2. Check current release information and known fixes when available:
   - `gh release list --limit 10`
   - `gh release view <tag>`
   - linked issues, merged PRs, release notes, local git tags/history, and both open and closed possible duplicates
3. If network access or release metadata is unavailable, state the limitation in the triage comment instead of guessing.

If the issue targets an older OpenShell release and a newer release or merged PR appears to address the same behavior:

- If the reporter has already reproduced the issue on the fixed/current release, continue to Step 5.
- If the reporter has not tested the fixed/current release, identify a concrete fixing change before using `fixed-in-release`. If the causal link is uncertain, request a retest instead of declaring the issue fixed.

## Step 5: Diagnose and Validate

Assess the report by investigating the codebase. Use the `principal-engineer-reviewer` sub-agent via the Task tool:

```
Prompt the sub-agent with:
- The full issue title and body
- Instructions to evaluate with a skeptical lens:
  1. What persona and desired capability does the user story establish?
  2. Does the problem statement match current product behavior?
  3. Does the impact explain the consequences, current workaround, and why that workaround is insufficient?
  4. Are the acceptance criteria specific, observable, and consistent with the user story?
  5. Can the described workflow be reproduced or otherwise validated from the information given?
  6. Does the current product support the requested outcome, and what component owns the behavior?
  7. Is the report best classified as a bug, feature request, support request, or another category?
  8. If this is a feature request, is the proposed design technically coherent and feasible? Do not decide whether the project should accept it.
  9. Are there any open or closed issues that duplicate this?
  10. What uncertainty remains, and what exact evidence would resolve it?
```

Based on the sub-agent's analysis, also attempt to validate the report directly:

- For bug reports: check the relevant code paths, look for the described failure mode
- For feature requests: assess feasibility against the existing architecture
- For gateway deployment or infrastructure issues: reference the `debug-openshell-cluster` skill's known failure patterns
- For inference and provider-topology issues: reference the `debug-inference` skill's known failure patterns
- For CLI/usage issues: reference the `openshell-cli` skill's command reference

Record impact signals for the human decision: affected users and scope, regression status, workaround availability, severity evidence, and evidence quality. Do not convert those facts into a roadmap or sequencing recommendation.

## Step 6: Classify

Based on the investigation, classify the issue into one of these categories:

| Classification | Meaning | Agent action |
|---|---|---|
| **validated-bug** | Evidence confirms a real defect | Add relevant area/topic labels; replace triage/needs-info state with `state:validated`; leave open |
| **validated-feature** | The proposal is technically coherent and feasible | Add relevant area/topic labels; replace triage/needs-info state with `state:validated`; leave open |
| **needs-investigation** | The report is credible but needs a deeper spike | Add `spike` if available; replace triage/needs-info state with `state:validated`; leave open for a human decision on whether to invest in the spike |
| **needs-information** | Critical reproduction or environment evidence is missing | Replace `state:triage-needed` with `state:needs-info`; request the exact missing evidence |
| **cannot-reproduce** | A faithful attempt did not reproduce, but the report may still be valid | Replace `state:triage-needed` with `state:needs-info`; document the attempt and request discriminating evidence |
| **fixed-in-release** | A concrete released change fixes the reported behavior | Explain the fix and version; close only when the causal link is clear, otherwise request a retest |
| **duplicate** | Another open or closed issue is the canonical report | Link the canonical issue and close |
| **expected-behavior** | Code and documentation establish that the behavior is intentional | Explain the behavior and close |
| **support-request** | The report asks for usage help rather than tracking work | Provide the support route and close |
| **wrong-repository** | Another repository owns the affected component | Link the correct tracker and close |
| **security-report** | The report may contain a vulnerability | Avoid further public analysis and direct the operator to `SECURITY.md` for safe handling |

Do not use `validated-feature` to imply roadmap acceptance. Do not use `expected-behavior` to decline a technically valid feature request.

## Step 7: Post Triage Comment

Post a structured comment with the triage marker:

```markdown
> **📋 triage-agent**
>
> ## Triage Assessment
>
> **Classification:** <validated-bug | validated-feature | needs-investigation>
>
> ### Summary
> <What was established and confidence in the evidence.>
>
> ### Investigation
> <Reproduction results, code/release evidence, affected components, and duplicates.>
>
> ### Impact Signals
> - **Affected users/scope:** <facts or unknown>
> - **Regression:** <yes/no/unknown>
> - **Workaround:** <available/unavailable/unknown>
> - **Evidence quality:** <high/medium/low with reason>
>
> ### Human Decision Required
> Decide whether OpenShell should address this issue. If yes, apply
> `state:accepted`, associate it with a roadmap item, or do both, and decide
> whether the work remains human-owned. Either action records acceptance;
> roadmap placement additionally records sequencing.
> To queue investigation or planning for an unattended agent, also apply
> `agent:plan-requested`. You can instead directly ask an agent to use
> `create-spike` or `build-from-issue` on this issue. If no, close it as not
> planned and record the rationale.
```

For other outcomes, replace the impact and decision sections with the exact information request, objective resolution, or safe routing guidance.

Keep exactly one intake/triage state among `state:triage-needed`, `state:needs-info`, and `state:validated`. Remove `state:triage-needed` after every completed assessment. Never apply `state:accepted`, any `agent:*` label, or the `roadmap` label during triage. Never close a validated issue.

- **triage-issue** establishes technical validity and impact evidence.
- **Humans** decide whether to accept valid work and where it lands on the roadmap.
- **create-spike** deepens investigation only after that investment is approved.
- **build-from-issue** may be invoked directly for a specific issue. Unattended agents use `agent:plan-requested` to pick up planning and `agent:implementation-requested` to pick up implementation.

Triage is the assessment layer. It does not sequence work, accept it onto the roadmap, plan, or build.
