# ODH Downstream E2E Tests

Downstream-only integration tests for running OpenShell on OpenShift with
Open Data Hub (ODH) / OpenShift AI (RHOAI) workloads. These are complementary
to the upstream `e2e:kubernetes` suite: they cover ODH/RHOAI-specific
behavior that upstream does not, and do not duplicate upstream coverage.

This directory is fork-only and does not currently overlap upstream files.
The ODH feature and test binary are appended to `e2e/rust/Cargo.toml` in the
fork. The e2e image also changes shared build and documentation files; review
those changes after each upstream sync.

```

All ODH test functions compile into a single `odh` test binary
(`[[test]] name = "odh"` in `Cargo.toml`). Cargo generates test names that
include the full module path, e.g. `smoke::gateway::test_reachable`, which is
what enables tier-based nextest filters (`test(~smoke::)`, `test(~tier1::)`, ...).

Adding a new test area within a tier is just adding a `.rs` file and a `mod`
line in that tier's `mod.rs` — no file grows unbounded, and no other tier is
affected.

## Shared test helpers

Fork-local test code shared across tiers lives in `odh_harness/`, declared with
`mod odh_harness;` in `main.rs` and used as `crate::odh_harness::...` from any
tier module. Because all ODH tests compile into the single `odh` test binary, a
plain module is enough — no new crate and no workspace change.

- `odh_harness::oc` — the `oc` CLI helpers. `oc_command()` builds a
  `tokio::process::Command` for `oc`, injecting `--context` from
  `OPENSHELL_E2E_KUBE_CONTEXT_ACTIVE` (exported by `e2e/with-kube-gateway.sh`)
  when it is set, so every ODH test targets the same cluster the upstream
  harness does. `oc_json()` runs a query and parses `-o json` output, panicking
  with a descriptive message on any failure.
- `odh_harness::selinux::SelinuxAudit` — an opt-in scenario guard that detects
  OpenShift, requires every Ready worker to report `Enforcing`, records
  node-local audit cutoffs, and rejects OpenShell AVCs on completion.

Put ODH-specific shared helpers here (the `oc` builder and node-level SELinux
checks), and reuse them rather than
duplicating logic across tier files. Two rules keep this rebase-safe:

- **Do not** add ODH helpers to the upstream harness library
  (`e2e/rust/src/harness/`, `openshell_e2e::harness`). That is an upstream file
  tree; editing it breaks the fork-only guarantee. Keep consuming it for
  generic, non-ODH helpers (e.g. `openshell_e2e::harness::sandbox::SandboxGuard`).
- The module is named `odh_harness` (not `harness`) precisely so `use`
  statements never collide with the upstream `openshell_e2e::harness`.

## Test tiers

| Tier | Description | Time target |
|---|---|---|
| Smoke | Component-level critical tests | 5 min or less |
| Tier 1 | High-priority tests, excluding Smoke | 15 min or less |
| Tier 2 | Medium/low priority positive tests | No limit |
| Tier 3 | Negative and destructive tests | No limit |
| ODH | All ODH tests | No limit |
| Full | Every feature-enabled upstream and ODH test, except listed exclusions | No limit |

`tiers.toml` maps each tier to upstream Cargo test binaries (explicit or
auto-discovered) and the ODH module filter that belong to it:

```toml
[smoke]
upstream_tests = []
odh_filter = "smoke::"
```

The upstream test assignments in `tiers.toml` are currently placeholders —
they should be revisited based on measured execution time and actual test
criticality, not just copied as-is.

Smoke covers gateway reachability, sandbox lifecycle, and image provenance.
Tier 1 checks the process-supervisor SELinux label and its mapped upstream
tests. Tier 2 and Tier 3 have no ODH scenarios yet; they run their mapped
upstream tests and the image provenance check. Add scenarios by creating a
`.rs` file under the tier's directory and declaring it with a `mod` line in
that tier's `mod.rs`.

The nextest `e2e-odh` profile runs the serial sandbox lifecycle tests and
`tier1::selinux` tests in one group with `max-threads = 1`, preserving
serialization across nextest's separate test processes. Tier 1 and Full
include the previously quarantined sandbox lifecycle tests.
Full applies its other exact upstream exclusions from
`[full.upstream_test_exclusions]`. Excluded tests do not appear as passes or
skips in the JUnit report.

## Prerequisites

- An OpenShift cluster with ODH/RHOAI installed, and the OpenShell gateway
  already deployed to it (via Helm or otherwise).
- `oc` CLI authenticated to that cluster.
- Rust toolchain and `mise` installed.
- Python 3.11 or newer, `cargo-nextest`, and `xsltproc` installed for tiered
  runs and HTML reports.
- The `openshell` CLI binary built (`cargo build -p openshell-cli`) and its
  active gateway pointed at the deployed OpenShell instance (`openshell
  gateway add ...` / `openshell gateway select ...`) — the harness shells out
  to this binary and relies on its persisted config, not on any env var.

### The `KUBECONFIG` gotcha

This repo's `mise.toml` sets `KUBECONFIG = "{{config_root}}/kubeconfig"` for
every `mise run` task — a worktree-local file, deliberately isolated from
your personal `~/.kube/config`, so automated e2e/dev tasks (which create,
tear down, and mutate cluster state) never accidentally act on whatever
context you happen to have active elsewhere. This means:

- `mise run e2e:odh:*` always reads cluster credentials from
  `<repo_root>/kubeconfig`, regardless of your shell's own `$KUBECONFIG` or
  `~/.kube/config`.
- If you're targeting an existing cluster (rather than the local k3d dev
  flow, which populates this file automatically), populate it yourself once:

  ```bash
  umask 077
  oc --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config config view --minify --flatten > kubeconfig
  chmod 600 kubeconfig
  ```

  (`--kubeconfig ~/.kube/config` is explicit on purpose — if mise's shell
  hook has already exported `KUBECONFIG` for this directory, an unqualified
  `oc config view` would read from the very file you're trying to create.
  The `umask`/`chmod` keep the flattened cluster credentials — an mTLS
  client cert and key — from being created group/world-readable.)

## How to run

| Command | What runs |
|---|---|
| `mise run e2e:odh` | All ODH-specific tests (all tiers, `odh` binary only), including image provenance |
| `mise run e2e:odh:full` | All upstream e2e + e2e-kubernetes + ODH tests (see caveat below), including image provenance |
| `mise run e2e:odh:smoke` | Smoke tier: mapped upstream tests + ODH `smoke::` (includes image provenance) |
| `mise run e2e:odh:tier1` | Tier 1: mapped upstream tests + ODH `tier1::` + image provenance |
| `mise run e2e:odh:tier2` | Tier 2: mapped upstream tests + ODH `tier2::` + image provenance |
| `mise run e2e:odh:tier3` | Tier 3: mapped upstream tests + ODH `tier3::` + image provenance |
| `cargo nextest run --manifest-path e2e/rust/Cargo.toml --features e2e-odh --test odh -E 'test(=module::test_name)'` | A single ODH test function |

Example, running the Smoke tier against a real cluster:

```bash
umask 077
oc --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config config view --minify --flatten > kubeconfig
chmod 600 kubeconfig
ALLOWED_IMAGE_REGISTRY_PREFIXES="quay.io/opendatahub/,nvcr.io/nvidia/base/" \
  mise run e2e:odh:smoke
```

`ALLOWED_IMAGE_REGISTRY_PREFIXES` is required by the image provenance test —
see below. For RHOAI images, use
`registry.redhat.io/,nvcr.io/nvidia/base/` instead. Set `NAMESPACE`/`RELEASE`
too if your deployment doesn't use the defaults (`openshell`/`openshell`).
The Quay deployment script sets
`sandbox.image.pullPolicy=IfNotPresent`; other deployments must
configure it themselves.

### SELinux-enforcing OCP validation

Tier 1 includes the SELinux checks when it runs against an OpenShift cluster.
The tests expect an already-deployed, working gateway. The named preflight
checks `getenforce` on every Ready worker. Each audited SELinux scenario uses
`SelinuxAudit`, which self-skips outside OpenShift, records node-local cutoffs,
and queries `ausearch -m AVC -x` through `oc debug node … chroot /host` after
the scenario.
The audit covers the gateway and both supervisor executable paths, and the
supervisor test checks the stable `container_t` type without hard-coding pod
MCS categories.

The runner requires permission to create debug pods and access the host through
`chroot /host`. Deployment-specific Helm values and proxy fixtures are owned by
the environment that deploys the gateway; tier1 does not create them. The
custom egress control is intentionally outside SELinux scope; egress behavior
remains covered by the existing proxy tests, and this tier does not create a
SELinux-specific proxy fixture.

### Why `e2e:odh` / `e2e:odh:full` run more than you might expect

`e2e-odh` activates the upstream `e2e-kubernetes` and `e2e` features.
`run-odh-test-tier.sh` selects tests with one nextest filter per tier.
`e2e:odh` selects the `odh` binary; `e2e:odh:full` selects every test binary
enabled by those features. Both produce JUnit XML and HTML in `results/`.

### Every `e2e:odh*` task runs the image provenance check

`smoke::image_provenance::test_sandbox_gateway_supervisor_images` is a
regular test in the `odh` binary. The smoke, ODH, and full filters include it.
Tier 1–3 filters include it alongside their assigned tests so one nextest run
and one JUnit report cover the whole tier. `SKIP_IMAGE_PROVENANCE=1` excludes
it from Tier 1–3 when a local deployment cannot meet the image requirements.
An empty tier fails instead of passing with an empty report. Tier 3 currently
has no scenarios, so skipping image provenance makes it fail.

## Image provenance verification

`smoke::image_provenance::test_sandbox_gateway_supervisor_images` creates a
sandbox, then verifies that its image, the gateway's image, and the
supervisor image (read from the rendered gateway config, since the
supervisor never runs as its own pod) all came from an authorized
registry, and that no container — including ephemeral containers — has
regressed away from `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent`.

```bash
ALLOWED_IMAGE_REGISTRY_PREFIXES="quay.io/opendatahub/,nvcr.io/nvidia/base/" \
  cargo test --manifest-path e2e/rust/Cargo.toml --features e2e-odh --test odh \
  -- smoke::image_provenance::
```

- `ALLOWED_IMAGE_REGISTRY_PREFIXES` (required, comma-separated, each prefix
  must end in `/`) — no default, since an empty list would silently approve
  any image. This should include every registry prefix your deployment
  legitimately pulls from:
  - `quay.io/opendatahub/` — the Quay deployment script's default repository
    namespace for the midstream gateway, supervisor, and sandbox runtime
    images.
  - `registry.redhat.io/` — RHOAI component images.
  - `nvcr.io/nvidia/base/` — the Helm chart's current default workload
    image (`server.sandboxImage`). Include the registry prefix for any
    other workload image selected by the deployment.

  A prefix without a trailing `/` is rejected outright, since it could
  otherwise match a lookalike host (e.g. `registry.redhat.io` would also
  match `registry.redhat.io.attacker.example/image`).
- `NAMESPACE`/`RELEASE` env vars default to `openshell`/`openshell`.
- The check is a registry-prefix allowlist, not an exact image/digest match.
  It checks each observed image against the configured allowed prefixes.
- The `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent` check applies to every container,
  including the sandbox pod's. The Quay deployment script sets
  `sandbox.image.pullPolicy=IfNotPresent`; other deployments must set it
  explicitly.
- Requires the `oc` CLI in PATH with a kubeconfig targeting the cluster (same
  as the rest of this suite). When `OPENSHELL_E2E_KUBE_CONTEXT_ACTIVE` is set,
  all provenance queries use that context; otherwise they use the kubeconfig's
  current context.
- Skip it locally with `SKIP_IMAGE_PROVENANCE=1 mise run e2e:odh:tier1` when
  testing a local deployment. Smoke, ODH, and full always include it.

## E2E container image

The Konflux `odh-openshell-e2e` image builds the OpenShell CLI and the
`e2e-odh` nextest archive from this checkout. It includes `cargo`,
`cargo-nextest`, `oc`, `kubectl`, Helm, Python 3.11, `xsltproc`, Git, and the SSH
client used by sandbox lifecycle tests.
See [the ODH image build overview](../../../../deploy/konflux/e2e-odh/README.md)
for its build and runtime boundaries.
The image is built for x86_64 and aarch64 from pinned Cargo, RPM, and generic
artifacts. On Linux with Hermeto, `rpm`, and Podman installed, build it
locally with:

```shell
./deploy/konflux/build-local.sh e2e-odh
```

The local build tags the image as `odh-openshell-e2e`.

The image accepts `smoke`, `tier1`, `tier2`, `tier3`, `odh`, or `full`
as its first argument; `smoke` is the default. The Shift-Left job mounts
cluster credentials and a writable report directory, then passes environment
variables through `--env-file`:

```shell
# Login to the cluster storing the kubeconfig file in the current folder
oc login --token=XXXXXX \
--server=https://api.example.com:443 \
--kubeconfig $PWD/kubeconfig

# Run the e2e tests
podman run --rm \
  -v /path/to/reports:/home/odh/openshell-e2e-odh/results:Z,U \
  -v /path/to/kubeconfig:/home/odh/openshell-e2e-odh/.kube/config:ro,Z \
  --env-file containerEnvFile \
  quay.io/opendatahub/odh-openshell-e2e:odh-stable smoke
```

By default, the entrypoint calls
`odh/scripts/openshell-deploy-from-quay.sh deploy --yes`, runs the tier,
then calls `teardown --yes` even if tests fail. The deploy script refuses to
replace an existing namespace unless
`OPENSHELL_E2E_REPLACE_EXISTING=1` is set and the namespace has the
`openshell.nvidia.com/deployed-by=odh-e2e` label. Failed deployments are
cleaned up after namespace creation; validation failures preserve local
gateway registration. SIGTERM is forwarded to nextest before teardown.
The kubeconfig must permit
namespace creation, Helm deployment, and the OpenShift operations used by
the tests. Set `OPENSHELL_E2E_DEPLOY_GATEWAY=0` only when a gateway is
already deployed and configured for the CLI inside the container.

The environment file must set `IMAGE_TAG` for the gateway, supervisor,
and sandbox images, plus `ALLOWED_IMAGE_REGISTRY_PREFIXES` for the
provenance test. By default, the deployment uses the
`quay.io/opendatahub/odh-openshell-*` midstream repositories.
Override `QUAY_NAMESPACE`, `GATEWAY_IMAGE`, `SUPERVISOR_IMAGE`, or
`SANDBOX_IMAGE` when testing another repository. `NAMESPACE`, `RELEASE`,
`ROUTE_HOST`, and `GATEWAY_NAME` control the deployment. The image writes
`e2e-odh-<tier>.xml` and
`e2e-odh-<tier>.html` to `results/`. Set
`OPENSHELL_E2E_REPORT_NAME` to choose another basename. The JUnit report
is produced by one nextest invocation per tier.

Konflux automation creates the Tekton YAML files for the e2e image.

## Rebase guidance

- **Fork-only paths:** this directory (`e2e/rust/tests/odh/`),
  `tasks/test-odh.toml`, the new e2e image files under
  `deploy/konflux/e2e-odh/`, `deploy/docker/`, and `odh/scripts/`.
- **Shared files:** the image adds to `.config/nextest.toml`,
  `deploy/konflux/build-local.sh`, and `.dockerignore`. Review these edits
  whenever upstream changes those files. The fork also carries the
  `e2e-odh` feature and `odh` test entry in `e2e/rust/Cargo.toml`; preserve
  those entries when syncing upstream changes to that file.
- **Shared harness dependency:** ODH tests use the upstream test harness
  library (`e2e/rust/src/`, e.g. `openshell_e2e::harness::binary::openshell_cmd`,
  `openshell_e2e::harness::sandbox::SandboxGuard`). If upstream changes those
  signatures, the ODH test modules need the same adaptation during rebase.
- **Upstream test inventory changes:** if upstream adds, removes, or renames
  `[[test]]` binaries, update the `upstream_tests` lists in `tiers.toml`
  accordingly.
- If upstream adds OpenShift auto-detection to `e2e:kubernetes`, this suite
  stays additive — it exercises ODH/RHOAI-specific behavior beyond what
  upstream covers, and `e2e-odh`'s dependency on `e2e-kubernetes` means
  upstream harness improvements propagate automatically.
