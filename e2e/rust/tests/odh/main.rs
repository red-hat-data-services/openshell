//! ODH/RHOAI downstream integration tests.

//! This binary is complementary to the upstream e2e suite: it exercises
//! behavior specific to running OpenShell on OpenShift with ODH/RHOAI
//! workloads. See TESTING-odh.md for tiering and how to run these tests.
//!
//! Test names include the full module path (e.g. `smoke::gateway::test_reachable`),
//! enabling tier-based filtering with `-- smoke::`, `-- tier1::`, etc.
