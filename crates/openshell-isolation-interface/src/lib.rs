//! The `OpenShell` **Isolation Backend** runtime contract (RFC 0012).
//!
//! An isolation backend establishes and enforces a workload's isolation boundary;
//! the supervisor role drives it through one contract. The supervisor-facing
//! contract lives in [`contract`]: an object-safe, runtime-selectable backend
//! plus a fixed chain of boxed lifecycle states the supervisor advances without
//! branching on placement. Each driver places a sandbox boundary beside the
//! workload and connects it to a separate supervisor.
//!
//! The backend establishes standing enforcement before untrusted code runs and
//! ensures launch-time controls are in force before each process's first
//! untrusted instruction. It also exposes process operations and supplies
//! workload egress to supervisor-owned network mediation.
//!
//! # Ordering is a security property
//!
//! The lifecycle states run in order: attach -> Bound -> confirm -> Ready ->
//! `start_agent` -> Running. Nothing untrusted runs inside the boundary until it
//! is confirmed ready. This is enforced *by construction*: each transition
//! consumes the prior state by value. Trusted backends construct confirmation
//! through [`contract::ConfirmedBoundary::try_new`], which checks common evidence
//! before the supervisor can obtain a [`contract::ReadyBoundary`].
//!
//! [`AgentSpec`] is shared between the workload definition the supervisor
//! submits and the [`contract::SandboxContext`] that `attach` binds to a
//! boundary.

/// The agent workload to run inside the boundary.
///
/// Carried by [`contract::SandboxContext`] so a backend's `start_agent` takes no
/// spec; the bound boundary already carries what runs inside it.
