//! The in-pod binary-identity resolver (RFC 0012 runtime contract).
//!
//! RFC 0012 delivers executable identity on every
//! [`MediatedConnection`](openshell_isolation_interface::contract::MediatedConnection):
//! the backend resolves identity for the accepted connection before mediation.
//! An unresolved identity denies that connection. This is the in-pod
//! resolution mechanism — procfs, keyed by the workload-side TCP peer port —
//! kept in this crate on purpose: the proxy that consumes identity is here, and
//! so are procfs and the binary identity cache. Stronger backends may use a
//! different resolution mechanism without changing the contract. The result
//! type lives in the lower `openshell-isolation-interface` crate (network ->
//! interface -> core, acyclic).
//!
//! The legacy listener still resolves identity in the proxy hot path. The RFC
//! 0012 co-located source invokes this resolver before returning each accepted
//! connection, so mediation consumes the bound identity result.
